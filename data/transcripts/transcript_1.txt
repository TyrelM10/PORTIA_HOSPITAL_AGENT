Junior Doctor (Dr. Anika): Hi Mr. Verma, I had a look at your temperature and symptoms. You’re still running a mild fever, right?

Mr. Verma: Yes, especially in the evenings. And my head feels heavy since this morning.

Dr. Anika: Okay. Nothing too serious, but I’ll prescribe Paracetamol 500mg—take one tablet after meals, twice a day for five days. It should help with the fever and the headache.

Mr. Verma: Alright. I’ve taken Paracetamol before, it usually works.

Dr. Anika: Also, if you notice any acidity or discomfort before meals, I’ll add Rantac 150. Just take it before eating if needed.

Mr. Verma: Got it. Do I need to pick these up or will someone get them?

Dr. Anika: I’ll send this directly to the medical store so it’ll be ready for pickup. You don’t need to do anything else.

Mr. Verma: Thanks, that’s helpful.
