Junior Doctor (Dr. Riya): Good afternoon, Miss Das. I saw your throat exam notes—still feeling soreness?

Miss Das: Yeah, swallowing is uncomfortable, especially when I wake up. It eases up a bit during the day.

Dr. Riya: That’s pretty common in mild infections. I’m prescribing Azithromycin 250mg—one tablet a day, after meals, for three days.

Miss Das: Okay, and is that an antibiotic?

Dr. Riya: Yes, a mild one. I’m also including a Vitamin C tablet—take one each day for a week to help your body recover faster.

Miss Das: Do I need to go to the pharmacy?

Dr. Riya: Nope, I’ll send it to the pharmacist now. You’ll just pick it up later today.

Miss Das: That’s easy—thanks a lot, Doctor.
